# 📘 NumPy Learning Repository

Welcome to my NumPy learning repo! This is where I explore and practice the fundamentals of **NumPy**, the powerful numerical computing library in Python. Whether you're also learning or just curious, feel free to browse through the notebooks and scripts.

## 🚀 What You'll Find Here

- ✅ Basics of NumPy arrays
- 🔄 Array operations (arithmetic, broadcasting, etc.)
- 🧱 Reshaping and slicing arrays
- 📊 Working with mathematical functions
- 🧮 Linear algebra with NumPy
- 📈 Basic data analysis techniques
- ⏱️ Performance comparisons (e.g., list vs NumPy)

2. **Set up your Python environment** (recommended):
- Create a virtual environment:
  ```
  python -m venv venv
  source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
  ```
- Install NumPy if you don't have it already:
  ```
  pip install numpy
  ```

3. **Explore the scripts**:
- Each Python file focuses on a specific NumPy topic.
- Run the scripts individually to see examples and practice:
  ```
  python 01_array_basics.py
  ```

4. **Modify and experiment**:
- Feel free to tweak the code or add your own examples.
- Use this repo as a hands-on playground to deepen your understanding of NumPy.

5. **Further learning**:
- Combine concepts from different scripts.
- Try applying NumPy to your own data analysis or projects.
